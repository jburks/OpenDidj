This is the DPC driver documentation.  The DPC driver supports the LF1000's
Display Controller (DPC) as well as providing general LCD control such as 
external LCD controller settings and backlight control.

   2) Creating /dev/dpc Device
   3) Application Interface
   4) Debugging

1) Building and Installing

This driver can be built as a module or as part of the kernel by using the
kernel build system.  Select the CONFIG_L1000_DPC option to build it.  Note 
that this driver depends on the GPIO, SPI, and PWM drivers.

2) Creating /dev/dpc Device

You may need to create the /dev/dpc device during initial installation.  To do
so, you must know the DPC's major number (DPC_MAJOR in dpc.h).  For example, 
to create the device with a major number 252:

$ mknod /dev/dpc c 252 0
$ chmod a+rw /dev/dpc

3) Application Interface

DPC configuration from user space is done through ioctl() calls.  See
include/linux/lf1000/dpc_ioctl.h for more information.

4) Debugging

The DPC driver allows the DPC registers to be inspected at any time by
reading a file in /proc.  This capability is available only if the driver was
built for a kernel with CONFIG_PROC_FS enabled.  First, ensure that /proc is
mounted:

$ mount /proc

The /proc/driver directory contains a 'dpc' file.  You may read the file with 
the 'cat' command, for example:

$ cat /proc/driver/dpc

Refer to the LF1000 data book for DPC register definitions.
