# fwcheck-cart checks if an installed cart has a firmware update and
# that update is needed.  If a firmware update is in order, fwcheck-cart

# it prints nothing.  A firmware update is in order under the following
# condition:
# 
# 1) If a package named firmware-*.lfp exists in /Cart/updates whose
# version is higher different than the current firmware version.
