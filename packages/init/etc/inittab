# /etc/inittab init(8) configuration for BusyBox
#
# Copyright (C) 1999-2004 by Erik Andersen <andersen@codepoet.org>
#
#
# Note, BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels.  The runlevels field is
# completely ignored by BusyBox init. If you want runlevels, use sysvinit.
#
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# <id>: WARNING: This field has a non-traditional meaning for BusyBox init!
#
#	The id field is used by BusyBox init to specify the controlling tty for
#	the specified process to run on.  The contents of this field are
#	appended to "/dev/" and used as-is.  There is no need for this field to
#	be unique, although if it isn't you may have strange results.  If this
#	field is left blank, it is completely ignored.  Also note that if
#	BusyBox detects that a serial console is in use, then all entries
#	containing non-empty id fields will be ignored.  BusyBox init does
#	nothing with utmp.  We don't need no stinkin' utmp.
#
# <runlevels>: The runlevels field is completely ignored.
#
# <action>: Valid actions include: sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, once,
#                                  restart, ctrlaltdel, and shutdown.
#
#       Note: askfirst acts just like respawn, but before running the specified
#       process it displays the line "Please press Enter to activate this
#       console." and then waits for the user to press enter before starting
#       the specified process.
#
#       Note: unrecognised actions (like initdefault) will cause init to emit
#       an error message, and then go along with its business.
#
# <process>: Specifies the process to be executed and it's command line.
#
# Note: BusyBox init works just fine without an inittab. If no inittab is
# found, it has the following default behavior:
#         ::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
#         ::askfirst:/bin/sh
#         ::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
#         ::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a
#         ::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
#         ::restart:/sbin/init
#
# if it detects that /dev/console is _not_ a serial console, it will
# also run:
#         tty2::askfirst:/bin/sh
#         tty3::askfirst:/bin/sh
#         tty4::askfirst:/bin/sh
#
# Boot-time system configuration/initialization script.
# This is run first except when booting in single-user mode.
#
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

# /bin/sh invocations on selected ttys
#
# Note below that we prefix the shell commands with a "-" to indicate to the
# shell that it is supposed to be a login shell.  Normally this is handled by
# login, but since we are bypassing login in this case, BusyBox lets you do
# this yourself...
#
::respawn:-/bin/sh

# Stuff to do when restarting the init process
::restart:/sbin/init

# Stuff to do before rebooting
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/etc/init.d/shutdown
