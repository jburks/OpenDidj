The use this utlity, make sure that your kernel is built with CONFIG_I2C and
CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV enabled.  Create character device node /dev/i2c-0 (major
89, minor 0) on your rootfs.  If your I2C support is built as modules, load
the modules (i2c-core, i2c-dev, i2c-yourdriver) before running this utility.

To write to a device:

./i2c-ctl w <address> <byte1> <byte2> ...

The <address> and <byteN> arguments are read as two-digits in hex format, ex:
94 for 0x94 or BC for 0xBC.  

To read from a device:

./i2c-ctl r <address> <byte1> <num>

This will cause <byte1> to be written to the device, and then <num> bytes to be
read back.  This is meant to be used for chips that require you to supply a
register number to read from.
